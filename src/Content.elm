The wedding will take place in two different locations in Cairo, Egypt.

For guests travelling from abroad, we recommend to arrive
in the weekend of 29/10 and to stay until 06/11.
During this week, we will organise some day trips to
discover Cairo and the many historical sites surrounding it.

In terms of accommodation, we recommend to stay in the Maadi area in Cairo.
This green, calm and central area is ideally located both to attend
the wedding and to discover downtown Cairo.

If you wish to stay in a hotel, we can recommend the following hotels:
1. [Holiday Inn][holiday_inn]
1. [Pearl][pearl]
1. [Villa Belle Epoque][belle_epoque]

Alternatively, you can also rent a room or apartment on AirBnB.
There are many good options in Cairo, but if you do not know the city,
you can best confirm the location with us before booking.
We also created
[a list with good options][airbnb] on AirBnB,
but make sure to check that the places corresponds to your preferences as well.

# Transportation

Cairo is a very big and densely populated city thatâ€™s notorious for its traffic.
The best way to get around in Cairo is either with Uber or by taking the metro.

For Uber, it is advisable to install the Uber application beforehand and
to link it with a credit card,
this will save you a lot of hassle since not all the drivers are very good at
English.
The prices for Uber rides are very reasonable, but it is best to avoid the
rush hours when both prices and the time you will spend in the car can go up
quite a lot.

Alternatively, you can use the Cairo Metro.
The metro is very cheap and does not get stuck in the busy Cairo traffic.
Be aware that it can also get very busy in rush hour though.
If your location is not close to a metro station,
there is still the option to take an Uber for the final part of your journey,
but to do part of the journey by metro to avoid traffic.

Walking is also an option, if you do not need to go far, and there are many
nice areas to stroll around.
Be mindful of the traffic though when walking in busy streets and
when crossing the street.

[Here's a little teaser][cairo_traffic] in case you are curious.

# Food and drinks

Cairo has everything to offer when it comes to food, and quality and hygiene
standards are very good.
When staying in Maadi, we can recommend the following restaurants:
1. [Lokali](https://goo.gl/maps/6GxZSeZTnYnXJDzLA) has a great garden and very
   nice fresh food
1. [Ovio](https://goo.gl/maps/zc5cu8QqxQ7mwfvWA) is great for breakfast or
   lunch
1. [Zooba](https://goo.gl/maps/tNtdtaLuN5TrfirH6) has great taameyya, the
   Egyptian version of falafel, and other kinds of "street food".
   This street offers many more options and is one of the main streets in
   Maadi for food and drinks

We can recommend a lot more places, also in other areas, so do not hesitate
to ask!

Regarding water, it is best to avoid drinking tap water, and to buy bottled
water instead or to use the water dispenser in your hotel or apartment if
there is one.
Cooking or brushing your teeth with tap water is perfectly fine though.

# Weather

The weather in November should be very pleasant.
Skies are usually clear with plenty of sunshine.
Be aware though that evenings can still be quite cool, so you best pack a
sweater, a light jacket, and long pants as well!

# Dress code

Egypt is a rather conservative country, and so it is advisable to dress rather
modestly.
When walking on the street, it's best to avoid short skirts (above the knee),
and to avoid showing shoulders or cleavage.

# Visas

Most non-Egyptians will require a visa to enter Egypt.
information on Egypt's visa policy can be found on
[this Wikipedia page][egypt_visa_policy].
However, it is best to cross-check this information either with
the travel advisories provided by the foreign affairs ministry of your country
or with the Egyptian embassy.

[egypt_visa_policy]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Egypt

## On-arrival visa

If you have a passport that makes you eligible for a visa on arrival,
then this is by far the easiest option.
In that case you do not need any documents beside your passport and
the address where you will be staying.
You can buy the on-arrival visa at the airport in Cairo at the counter on
the right just before the immigration checkpoint.
The on-arrival visa will cost you $25 and needs to be paid in cash, either in
euro or in USD.
You will receive a visa sticker,
**do not put the visa in your passport yourself**,
but give it to the officer at the immigration checkpoint, who will put it in your
passport and stamp it.

## e-Visa

Alternatively, you can buy an e-Visa online on the [Egypt e-Visa Portal][evisa].
In the FAQ you will find the list of nationalities eligible for an e-Visa.

## Visa from the embassy

If you are not eligible for either an on-arrival visa or an e-Visa, you will
need to contact the nearest Egyptian embassy to introduce a visa application.
In this case, it is probably best to inform yourself well in advance about the
duration of the procedure.
